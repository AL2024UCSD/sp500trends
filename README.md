# S&P 500 Trends and Geopolitical Risk

This repository contains the code and data for a DSC 190 project analyzing how the S&P 500 index evolves over time in relation to geopolitical risk and key macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, unemployment, and interest rates.

The core of the analysis is implemented in `mainwork.ipynb`, which performs data cleaning, merging, and visualization using monthly U.S. macroeconomic series, the S&P 500 index, and a Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR).
